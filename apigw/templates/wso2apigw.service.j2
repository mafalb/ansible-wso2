# The Type=simple approach is not safe: if a user starts the server using the

# Use WSO2 PID file; this allows to still use wso2server.sh start|stop commands
# directly from command line in combination with systemctl. 'Systemctl status' will
# not detect that wso2server.sh start has been executed directly, but will correctly
# stop the server when the system is shutdown or 'systemctl stop' is executed. Systemctl
# will also not start another instance of the server when 'systemctl start' is executed.
